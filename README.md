## How did I create the application?

1. Firstly if rails is not installed on my setup I ran this command:

```
# To install:
gem install rails

# To verify:
rails --version
```

2. Create the new application in any directory:

```
rails new book-dice
```

3. Then run rails server:

```
rails server
# or the shortcut version
rails s
```
